# require 'pry'
# how to define a prime number
# First, take the square root (or the 1/2 power) of n; then round this number up to the next highest whole number and call the result m.  Then find all of the following quotients:
#
# qm = n / m
# q(m-1) = n / (m-1)
# q(m-2) = n / (m-2)
# q(m-3) = n / (m-3)
# . . .
# q3 = n / 3
# q2 = n / 2
#
# The number n is prime if -- and only if -- none of the q's, as derived above, are whole numbers.


# Add  code here!

def prime?(n)

	# A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself
	if n < 2
		return false

	elsif n == 2
		return true

	else
		# take the square root of int, then round up to whole number
		m = Integer.sqrt(n) + 1
		# turn number range into array
		num_arr = (2...m).to_a
		# if n/m..2 is a whole number, then it is not a prime number
		num_arr.each do |x|
			if n % x == 0
				return false
			end
		end
		return true
	end
	false
end

# if we need to return value in the middle of the method, must add "return" before the statement
